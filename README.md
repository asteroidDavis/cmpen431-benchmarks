optSim.sh - Runs simplesclar benchmarks for CMPEN 431 at PSU. 

Example:

sh optSim.sh 
Enter configs:
<configs>

Result:
sim1.out will be added in each benchmarks folder.
If sim1.out already exists in the folder the old version will be dated with the current time.

Attention:
Your directory structure must match mine. Ie. each directory needs tmp.cfg or a link to tmp.cfg.
Aslo this will delete any files named conf.cfg in the directories containg tmp.cfg.
